## **WELCOME TO THE "INTRO TO MLOPS AND ML ENGINEERING" WORKSHOP!**

### **DESCRIPTION:**
##### In this workshop, we'll explore the ML Lifecycle in an end-to-end fashion by creating a model that solves a real-world problem.

### **CONTEXT:**
##### Truecar.com is an online platform for private parties to sell used cars. You have been hired by them to build and deploy an ML model that gives users a recommended listing price based on their vehicle's specifications. They would like a proof of concept before building out the model on their Google Cloud account.

##### To solve this problem, we will build a Decision Tree Regression Model to predict the price of a Used Car given its various features.

### **INSTRUCTIONS:**
1. Open a New Codespace in this Repository.
2. Go to the "price-prediction.ipynb" file.
3. Run the Streamlit App by running the following command in the Terminal:
   "streamlit run PricePredictionApp.py"
