    "###### 1. **Data Sources**: We identified relevant data sources.\n",
    "###### 2. **Data Ingestion**: We got the data from the data sources identified.\n",
    "###### 3. **Data Storage**: We found a temporary storage repository for the data we ingested.\n",
    "###### 4. **Data Wrangling**: We cleaned the data to make it useable for analysis.\n",
    "###### 5. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: We identified outliers, relationships between variables, and any missing values.\n",
    "###### 6. **Data Preprocessing**: We formatted the data in a way where the machine can make sense of the data."

Although the majority of these may be helpful when predicting or classifying an observation, there will be quite a few that may create \"noise\" during the training process."

    "##### It is a central location where you can either create or update groups of features created from multiple different data sources, or create and update new datasets from those feature groups for training models or for use in applications that do not want to compute the features but just retrieve them when it needs them to make predictions."
